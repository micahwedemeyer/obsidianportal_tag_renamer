h2. Bulk Tag Renamer

This is a little Obsidian Portal API test app that I wrote. The main purpose was to verify that the API works and functions as intended.

The second purpose is to make it easy to bulk edit your tags. This will become especially important once we switch tags over to being case sensitive.

h2. Hosted at Heroku (eventually)

Eventually, this will be hosted at Heroku for everyone to use. When that happens, I'll update the README to include a link.

h2. Apologies for the quality

My apologies for the quality of the code. I was mainly just trying to bang it out as quickly as I could. Rest assured that the actual Obsidian Portal backend is much better architected and has a full test suite.
